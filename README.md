# learning-chat-bot

Hey I would like to introduce my learning chat bot, this chat bot has the capability to learn from you and answer on the questions you teach him to,
and he never forgets. Slowly but surely after you train him more than a year, or month, he would become a living human. Note - (he's bad at geography, dont ask geography questions)
the folder "Learning Chat Bot" will contain the code and the json file where the data of the chat bot is stored, (and it would also be apprecieated if you could follow for more)

I hope you like my project/repository.
Thanks!
