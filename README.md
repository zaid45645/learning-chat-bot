# learning-chat-bot
This Repo/Repository is an example of a learning chat bot, which stores the questions and answers in a json file, and answers them wth the help of it.
The code in the folder "Learning Chat Bot" will be a "knowledge_base.json" and an "main.python".
the "main.python" file will contain all the code and "knowledge_base.json" is the json file for storing the chat bot's data.

I hope you like my repository.
Thanks!
